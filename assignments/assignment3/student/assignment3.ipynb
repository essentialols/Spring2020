    "In this assignment we'll conduct an exploratory data analysis of professional basketball data.  Basketball is a team sport in which the goal is to try to outscore the amount in a fixed amount of time. Points are scored (either 2 or 3 points) by putting the ball throw a hoop on one end of the court.  An attempt at putting the ball throw the hoop is known as a \"shot\".  If helpful, you can read more about [the rules of basketball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_basketball).\n",

In this part, we will divide the court into square regions and create a matrix which includes the number of shots taken by a player in that region.  We divide the court up into square bins (e.g. a 2d histogram), and, for each player, count number of shots that fall into each bin.

We've identified potentially interesting patterns of shooting styles without actually specifying anything about the way basketball is played or where the relevant lines are on the court.  The resulting images are based only on the actual behavior of the players.  Even more impressive is that we're capturing similarity in regions that are far apart on the court.  One reason we can do this is that a basketball court is symmetric along the length of the court (i.e. symmetric about x=0).  However, people tend to be left or right hand dominant, which might affect their preferences.  Look carefuly at the shot basis plots above: is there any evidence of _asymmetry_ in player shooting behavior?  Refer to specific basis images in your answer.    \n",
