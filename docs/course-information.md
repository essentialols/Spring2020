### Description

Overview and use of data science tools in Python for data retrieval, analysis, visualization, reproducible research and automated report generation. Case studies will illustrate the practical use of these tools.

In past offerings of PSTAT 134/234, case studies included,

* Web data scraping and preprocessing with command line tools
* Spatial analysis of NBA shots data
* Portfolio selection using historical stock returns
* Topic modeling using Yelp review data
* Recommendation system using missing movie ratings data

### PSTAT 134 vs. PSTAT 234

PSTAT 234 will be taught as a graduate student class. You will be expected to [_learn-to-learn_](https://hbr.org/2016/03/learning-to-learn) how to apply the course topics to real applications.

As compared to PSTAT 134, there will be

* More open-ended assigments (mini-projects)
* More theoretical treatment of concepts and methodologies
* Notebook interactivity (widgets and visualizations)
* Tools and practices for research reproducibility

You will also be asked to learn about using various software tools on your own (see below).

### Computing Tools

Programming/scripting is a significant portion of this class. Below is a list of my expectations.

* _Required_: Python at a level comparable to
    * [http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)
    * [http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) (including Pandas)

* _Recommended_: Git at a level comparable to 
    * [http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
    
* _Recommended_: Unix shell at a level comparable to
    * [http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)

Prior knowledge of Git and Unix shell is not critical; however, you will be asked to learn on your own as you go.
